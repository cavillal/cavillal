- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cavillal (Claudio)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested and curious in understanding how the brain work (in general). 
-   More specifically I'm interested in the how changes in neuronal activity and networks can translate to specific behaviors. Check out my website for more details (https://sites.google.com/view/cavillal/home)
- ðŸ“« You can contact me at cavillal@gmail.com or check my website https://sites.google.com/view/cavillal/home. 
-   Looking forward to interact and colaborate with colleagues or people interested to talk about the brain or science in general :)
